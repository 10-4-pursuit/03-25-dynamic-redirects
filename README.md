## Objective
Learn to handle invalid or undefined route parameters by implementing dynamic redirects in a React application. Create a user profile page that redirects to a default route if the specified user ID is invalid or undefined.

## Setup

1. **Create an 'Exercises' Directory** (If not already done):
   - If you haven't already, create a main directory on your local machine to house all your exercises. You can do this using `mkdir Exercises`.

2. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Navigate to the GitHub repository for this exercise at `03-25-dynamic-redirects`.
   - Click on the 'Fork' button to create a fork of the repository.

3. **Clone Your Forked Repository**:
   - Open your terminal.
   - Navigate to your `Exercises` directory using `cd path/to/Exercises`.
   - Run `git clone <your-forked-repo-url>` to clone the repository to your machine.
   - This will create a new directory named `03-25-dynamic-redirects` under `Exercises`.

4. **Initial Setup**:
   - The repository already includes the skeleton code generated by Create React App, along with a `data` folder in the `src` directory containing the `users.json` file.
   - Navigate to the exercise directory: `cd 03-25-dynamic-redirects`.
   - Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
- Start the development server with `npm start`.

## `users.json` Structure
The `users.json` file in the `data` folder will have the following structure:

```json
{
  "validUserIds": ["user1", "user2", "user3", ...]
}
```
This file contains an array of valid user IDs.

## Exercise Instructions

1. **Implement a User Profile Route**:
   - Create a `UserProfile` component that displays user information based on a `userId` provided in the URL (e.g., `/profile/:userId`).
   - Import the list of valid user IDs from `users.json`.

2. **Handling Invalid User IDs**:
   - In the `UserProfile` component, check if the `userId` is present in the list of valid user IDs.
   - If the `userId` is invalid or undefined, programmatically redirect the user to a default route (e.g., `/profile/default`).

3. **Hint for Redirects**:
   - Use the `useNavigate` hook from `react-router-dom` to programmatically navigate to the default route when an invalid user ID is encountered.   

4. **Testing the Redirects**:
   - Test the application by navigating to various user profiles with both valid and invalid IDs.
   - Ensure that valid user IDs display the correct profile and invalid or undefined IDs redirect to the default route.

## Submission

1. **Commit Your Changes**:
   - After completing the exercise, ensure all your changes are saved.
   - Run `git add .` to stage your changes.
   - Run `git commit -m "Completed Dynamic Redirects exercise"` to commit your changes.

2. **Push to Your Fork**:
   - Run `git push` to push your commits to your forked repository on GitHub.

3. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Click on 'Pull Request' to create a new pull request to the original repository.
   - Ensure the pull request details are filled out, explaining the changes you made.
